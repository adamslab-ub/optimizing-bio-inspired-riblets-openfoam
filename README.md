# optimizing-bio-inspired-riblets-openfoam
This repository contains key software artifacts of the Open-FOAM based CFD framework that computes the drag coefficient of a NACA-0012 airfoil with bio-inspired surface riblets. This package also provides the framework to introduce your own optimization code for minimizing drag by varying the shape of the surface riblets. For further information about the methods underlying this software package, refer to our paper: Lulekar, S. S., Ghassemi, P., Alsalih, H., and Chowdhury, S., An Adaptive-Fidelity Design Automation Framework toExplore Bio-inspired Surface Riblets for Drag Reduction, AIAA Journal. 2020. AIAA.  The following sections provide further information on the usage of this software package:
